      <h2>What is biodiversity?</h2>
      <p>Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth. It includes all plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms. Biodiversity is essential for human health and well-being. It provides us with food, clean air and water, and regulates the climate.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Why is biodiversity important?</h2>
      <p>Biodiversity is important for many reasons. It provides us with food, clean air and water, and regulates the climate. It also helps to protect us from pests and diseases.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Food: Biodiversity provides us with a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and meat.</li>
        <li>Clean air and water: Biodiversity helps to filter our air and water, making them clean and safe for us to consume.</li>
        <li>Climate regulation: Biodiversity helps to regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Pest and disease control: Biodiversity helps to protect us from pests and diseases by providing a natural balance to the ecosystem.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Examples of biodiversity</h3>
        <p>Biodiversity can be found all over the world, from the highest mountains to the deepest oceans. Here are a few examples of biodiversity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plants: There are over 380,000 known species of plants on Earth. Plants provide us with food, medicine, and materials for clothing and shelter.</li>
            <li>Animals: There are over 1.5 million known species of animals on Earth. Animals play an important role in the ecosystem by helping to control populations of pests and diseases.</li>
            <li>Fungi: Fungi are essential for the decomposition of organic matter. They also play a role in the production of food and medicine.</li>
            <li>Microorganisms: Microorganisms are tiny organisms that can be found everywhere on Earth. They play an important role in the ecosystem by decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Threats to biodiversity</h4>
        <p>Biodiversity is under threat from a number of human activities, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Habitat loss: Habitat loss is the biggest threat to biodiversity. When forests are cleared for agriculture or development, animals lose their homes and food sources.
            </li>
            <li>Overexploitation: Overexploitation occurs when we harvest natural resources at a faster rate than they can replenish themselves. This can lead to the decline or extinction of species.</li>
            <li>Pollution: Pollution can contaminate habitats and make them unsuitable for life. It can also poison animals and plants.</li>
            <li>Climate change: Climate change is causing the Earth's temperature to rise. This is disrupting ecosystems and threatening many species.
            </li>
        </ul>
